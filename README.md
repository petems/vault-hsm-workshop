# vault-hsm-workshop

## What?
A git-repo with all the material needed to run a presentation and demo on the integration between Vault and HSM devices

## Why?

HSM’s are expensive and complex pieces of equipment. This often leads to a situation where when it comes to using Vault with an HSM, they are often “gate kept” by a silo’d or separate team. I created this talk to help out in those situations.

## Who?
The intended audience for this presentation and demo would be the Sec, Crypto and/or Ops teams. The intention is to break down the barriers between Vault users and HSM maintainers, as well as explaining the benefits and differences between Vault and HSM's.

The deck can be modified to remove the explanations of what an HSM is if the team is only HSM SME’s, and skip straight to the Vault specifics: integrations and demo.

## Slides

Presentation slides avaliable in `slides/` as PDF and PPT

## Demos

Demos can be run via Vagrant or Docker, in their respective directories. All instructions will be in the main `README.md` for each directory.
